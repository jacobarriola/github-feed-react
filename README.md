# Search GitHub events by username
Demo: https://young-stream-95005.herokuapp.com/

Basically, I'm trying to replicate a user's activity feed on GitHub, but mostly
this was an exercise to fetch an external API on initial load via React. I've
recently expanded on this by creating a form to fetch different users.

I made this demo as part of my learning process and hope that it will help someone
else along their path in learning React. There's still lots to do here ~~since we
are basically just hitting an external endpoint and not really doing anything
dynamic in the UI.~~

## Credits
This was bootstrapped with the `create-react-app` project. Read their docs to find out
how this is organized: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app.

I learned all of my React with Wes Bos' online React For Beginners tutorial.

## To Do
* ~~Use `fetch()` API instead of jQuery - seems a bit much to load jQuery just for an API call.~~
* Create a filter allow users to fetch certain types of data
* ~~Create a form to make the username dynamic~~
* Show the user info
