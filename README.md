# Load Initial Data via AJAX
This is a demo React app that loads data via AJAX (jQuery). The basis for most
of the fetching comes from https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/initial-ajax.html

I made this demo as part of my learning process and hope that it will help someone
else along their path in learning React.

## To Do
Create a filter allow users to fetch certain types of data
Create a form to make the username dynamic
